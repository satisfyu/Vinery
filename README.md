Vinery contains nearly everything needed for not only creating wine but also for building up your own vinery. There are not only Blocks for crafting and refine Wine but also for decorating your Wineyard. 

Have fun crafting finest Wine, Cider or just some basic food Items. 

Consider downloading REI for recipe viewing. Let's Do Wine also has an in-game Patchouli guidebook called the "Book of Grapes" which will show you how to craft your first Wine.
