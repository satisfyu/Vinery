[1.5.3]

* Vinery Items not being compostable
* Removed deprecated and invalid item IDs from default trade configs
* Dark Cherry Saplings now correctly grow Dark Cherry Trees instead of Apple Trees 
* Wine aging is now stored per-bottle using server values, preventing pre-aged wines and client-dependent aging/effects on servers
* Added missing loottables for potted Vinery saplings (thanks to AraneaeDiscordia)
* Fixed a crash when inserting non-Vinery bottles into Wine Boxes, which could prevent worlds from loading
* Fixed multiple Vinery advancements not progressing or completing correctly due to invalid criterias

[1.5.1]

**Fixed**
* Resolved multiple invalid or missing tag assignments across block and item registries
* Corrected Cherry Boat render layer and model reference causing missing visuals

[1.5.0]

**Welcome to 1.21.1!**

***

[1.4.41]

**Fixed**
* `JungleWineRack` open/close property being inverted
* Wine aging did not update in tooltip or when consumed. Root causes:
    * cached NBT never recomputed
    * inverted `hasWineYear` prevented proper initialization
    * getter side-effects caused stale UI values
* `getDays`/`getYear` math stabilized; no unintended zeroing
* `JellieWine` Texture alignment

**Added**
* Debug commands for testing:
    * `/wine info` — shows current Age (years/days), effect amplifier, and duration (ticks) for the bottle in main hand
    * `/wine age <years>` — sets the NBT year so the item is treated as aged by `<years>` years immediately
